# Typing Club Autotyper Bookmarklet
Pretty self-explanatory

## Setup
- copy paste everything in autotyper.js (EVERYTHING)
- create bookmark, except instead of URL paste what you've copied
- go to a typingclub page and press bookmarklet

This doesn't quite work with lessons that include **tabs** or **enter keys**.

## Disclaimer
In addition, please do not use this if you're doing an assignment

This is purely for experimental purposes
