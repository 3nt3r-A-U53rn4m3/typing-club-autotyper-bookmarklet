# Typing Club Autotyper Bookmarklet
Pretty self-explanatory
- Working 2023 :)
- up to 200+ WPM

## Setup
- copy paste everything in autotyper.js (EVERYTHING)
- create bookmark, except instead of URL paste what you've copied
- go to a typingclub page and go to lessson
- **reload lesson**
- press bookmarklet

This doesn't quite work with lessons that include **tabs** or **enter keys**.
